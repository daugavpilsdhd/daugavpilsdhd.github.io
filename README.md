## Augmented Reality in the web browser

On the [site](https://daugavpilsdhd.github.io/) you can see a representation of 3 different churches of the Daugavpils church hill.

This project was done for the contest to show the ability of AR technology in the sphere of tourism.

(AR.js)[https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js] with [A-Frame](https://github.com/chenzlabs/aframe-ar) were mainly used to create this project.
